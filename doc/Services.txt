At the moment, ngIRCd doesn't implement a "special IRC services interface".
But services acting as a "regular server" are supported, either using the IRC
protocol defined in RFC 1459 or RFC 2812.

Services have been tested using "IRC Services" version 5.x of Andrew Church,
homepage: <http://www.ircservices.za.net/>. This document describes setting up
ngIRCd and these services.


Setting up ngIRCd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "pseudo server" handling the IRC services is configured as a regular
remote server in the ngircd.conf(5). In addition the variable "ServiceMask"
should be set, enabling this ngIRCd to recognize the "pseudo users" as IRC
services insted of regular IRC users.

Example:

  [SERVER]
     Name = services.irc.net
     MyPassword = 123abc
     PeerPassword = 123abc
     ServiceMask = *Serv


Setting up IRC Services 5.1.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IRC Services 5.1.x can be used with ngIRCd using the "rfc1459" protocol
module. At least the following settings have to be tweaked, in addition to all
the settings marked as required by IRC Services:

In ircservices.conf:

  Variable		Example value

  RemoteServer		server.irc.net 6667 "123abc"
  ServerName		"services.irc.net"
  LoadModule		protocol/rfc1459

In modules.conf:

  Module		protocol/rfc1459
