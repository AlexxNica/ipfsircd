[Global]

	# In the [global] section of this file, there is the place of the
	# main server configuration. Needed is only the variable "Name",
	# Info you can adjust, if you like to. For all the others variables,
	# you can use the defaults, this means you can leave it by default.
	
	# Server name in the IRC-network
	Name = irc.the.net
	
	# Info-text of the server. This will be shown i.e. by a WHOIS- or
	# LINKS-request.
	Info = Server Info Text
	
	# Information about the server and administrator in the ADMIN-request
	;AdminInfo1 = Description
	;AdminInfo2 = Location
	;AdminEMail = admin@irc.server
 
	# Ports, on which the server will listen. There may be more than
	# one port, separated with ";". (Default: 6667)
	;Ports = 6667, 6668, 66694
	
	# Textfile with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This will be shown
	# on a user connection with the server.
	;MotdFile = /usr/local/etc/ngircd.motd

	# User-ID, under which the server is started (for that the server
	# must be started with root-rights). You can use the name of the
	# user or the numerical ID.
	# ATTENTION: the configuration and the MOTD file must be readable
	# by this user, otherwise RESTART won't work!
	;ServerUID = 65534

	# Group-ID, under which the server is running (for that the server
	# must be started with root-rights). You can use the name of the
	# group or the numerical ID.
	;ServerGID = 65534

	# After <PingTimeout> seconds, the server will send a ping after
	# inactivity of this client.
	;PingTimeout = 120

	# If there is an answer of a client, to which the ping was sended,
	# not after <PongTimeout> seconds, it will be disconnected.
	;PongTimeout = 20

	# The server tries every <ConnectRetry> seconds, not yet connected
	# or not anymore connected servers to connect.
	;ConnectRetry = 60

	# Should IRC-operators be allowed to use the MODE command even if
	# they are not(!) channel-operators?
	;OperCanUseMode = no

	# Maximum number of simultanous connection the server is allowed
	# to accept (<=0 unlimited):
	;MaxConnections = -1

[Operator]
	# In this [operator]-section, there will be the configuration of
	# the name and password of an IRC operator. There may be more than
	# one operator-block (for each operator one).
	
	# ID of the operator (may be different of the nick)
	;Name = TheOper

	# Password of the operator
	;Password = ThePwd

[Server]
	# In this [Server] section, there is the configuration of the
	# servers, which are allowed to connect to your own server.
	# There may be more than one server-block.
	# If you configured a port for the connection, then the ngIRCd
	# tries to connect to this port. If not, it waits for the other
	# server.
	#
	# Server-groups:
	# The ngIRCd allows "server-groups": that means, that you can assign
	# server-groups for every server, to which you want the ngIRCd to
	# connect to. If one server of a server-group won't answer, the
	# ngIRCd tries the next one of this group.
	# ATTENTION: Server-groups will only work if you defined a port!
	
	# Hostname of the server
	;Host = connect-to-host.the.net

	# IRC-name of the server
	;Name = irc2.the.net
   
	# Port of the server, to which the ngIRCd should connect. If you
	# assign no port, the ngIRCd waits for an answer of that server.
	;Port = 6666

	# Own password for the connection. This password has to be configured
	# as "PeerPassword" on the other server.
	;MyPassword = MySecret

	# Foreign password for this connection. This password has to be
	# configured as "MyPassword" on the other server.
	;PeerPassword = PeerSecret
	
	# Group of that server (optional)
	;Group = 123

[Channel]
	# In the [Channel] there can be defined "persistent channels". This
	# means, that the server creates the channel and even if all users
	# left this channel, it will persist. There may be more than one
	# block. Signed with the mode "P", which  can be set or unset, like
	# normal modes.
	
	# Name of the channel
	;Name = #TheName

	# Topic for the channel
	;Topic = a great topic
	
	# Channel-modes
	;Modes = tn
