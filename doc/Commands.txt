               ngIRCd is free software and published under the
                   terms of the GNU General Public License.

                              -- Commands.txt --


This file lists all commands available on ngIRCd. It is written in a format
that is human readable as well as machine parseable and therefore can be used
as "help text file" of the daemon.

In short, the daemon reads this file on startup and parses it as following
when an user issues a "HELP <cmd>" command:

 1. Search the file for a line "- <cmd>",
 2. Output all subsequent lines that start with a TAB (ASCII 9) character
    to the client using NOTICE commands, treat lines containing a single "."
    after the TAB as empty lines.
 3. Break at the first line not starting with a TAB character.

This format allows to have information to each command stored in this file
which will not be sent to an IRC user requesting help which enables us to
have additional annotations stored here which further describe the origin,
implementation details, or limits of the specific command which are not
relevant to an end-user but administrators and developers.

A special "Intro" block is returned to the user when the HELP command is
used without a command name:


- Intro
	This is ngIRCd, a server software for Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
	networks. You can find more information about ngIRCd on its homepage:
		<http://ngircd.barton.de>
	.
	Use "HELP COMMANDS" to get a list of all available commands and
	"HELP <command-name>" to get help for a specific IRC command, for
	example "HELP quit" or "HELP privmsg".


Connection Handling Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CAP
	CAP LS
	CAP LIST
	CAP REQ <capabilities>
	CAP ACK <capabilities>
	CAP NAK <capabilities>
	CAP CLEAR
	CAP END
	.
	List, request, and clear "IRC Capabilities".
	.
	Using this command, an IRC client can request additional "IRC
	capabilities" during login or later on, which influences the
	communication between server and client. Normally, these commands
	aren't directly used by humans, but automatically by their client
	software. And please note that issuing such commands manually can
	irritate the client software used, because of the "non-standard"
	behavior of the server!
	.
	- CAP LS: list all available capabilities.
	- CAP LIST: list active capabilities of this connection.
	- CAP REQ: Request particular capabilities.
	- CAP ACK: Acknowledge a set of capabilities to be enabled/disabled.
	- CAP NAK: Reject a set of capabilities.
	- CAP CLEAR: Clear all set capabilities.
	- CAP END: Indicate end of capability negotiation during login,
	  ignored in an fully registered session.

	Please note that the <capabilities> must be given in a single
	parameter but whitespace separated, therefore a command could look
	like this: "CAP REQ :capability1 capability2 capability3" for example.

	 - <http://ircv3.atheme.org/specification/capability-negotiation-3.1>
	 - <http://ngircd.barton.de/doc/Capabilities.txt>
	 - doc/Capabilities.txt

- CHARCONV
	CHARCONV <client-charset>
	.
	Set client character set encoding to <client-charset>.
	.
	After receiving such a command, the server translates all message
	data received from the client using the set <client-charset> to the
	server encoding (UTF-8), and all message data which is to be sent to
	the client from the server encoding (UTF-8) to <client-charset>.
	.
	This enables older clients and clients using "strange" character sets
	to transparently participate in channels and direct messages to
	clients using UTF-8, which should be the default today.

	References:
	 - <http://ngircd.barton.de/doc/Protocol.txt>
	 - doc/Protocol.txt

- NICK
	NICK <nick>
	.
	Change your nickname to <nick>.

- PASS
	PASS <password> <version> <flags> [<options>]
	.
	Set a connection <password>. This command must be sent before the
	NICK/USER registration combination.
	.
	See doc/Protocol.txt for more info.

- PING
	PING <server1> [<server2>]
	.
	Tests the presence of a connection. A PING message results in a PONG
	reply. If <server2> is specified, the message gets passed on to it.

- PONG
	PONG <server1> [<server2>]
	.
	This command is a reply to the PING command and works in much the
	same way.

- QUIT
	QUIT [<quit-message>]
	.
	End IRC session and disconnect from the server.
	.
	If a <quit-message> has been given, it is displayed to all the
	channels that you are a member of when leaving.

- USER
	USER <user> <modes> <realname>
	.
	This command is used at the beginning of a connection to specify the
	<user>name, hostname, <realname> and initial user <modes> of the
	connecting client.
	.
	<realname> may contain spaces, and thus must be prefixed with a colon.

- WEBIRC
	See doc/Protocol.txt


General Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- AWAY
	AWAY [<message>]
	.
	Provides the server with a message to automatically send in reply to a
	PRIVMSG directed at the user, but not to a channel they are on.
	.
	If <message> is omitted, the away status is removed.

- HELP
	HELP [<command>]
	.
	Show help information for a specific IRC <command>. The <command> name
	is case-insensitive.
	.
	Use the command "HELP Commands" to get a list of all available commands.

	The HELP command isn't specified by any RFC but implemented by most
	daemons. If no help text could be read in, ngIRCd outputs a list of all
	implemented commands when receiving a plain "HELP" command as well as
	on "HELP Commands".

	ngIRCd replies using "NOTICE" commands like ircd 2.10/2.11; other
	implementations are using numerics 704, 705, and 706.


- MODE
	MODE <nickname> <flags> (user)
	MODE <channel> <flags> [<args>]
	.
	The MODE command is dual-purpose. It can be used to set both (user) and
	<channel> modes.
	.
	See doc/Modes.txt for more information.

- NOTICE
	NOTICE <target>[,<target>[,...]] <message>
	.
	Send a <message> to a given <target>, which can be a user or a
	channel, but DON'T report any error.
	.
	The "NOTICE" command exactly behaves like the "PRIVMSG" command, but
	doesn't report any errors it encounters (like an unknown <target>).
	Please see the help text of the "PRIVMSG" command for a detailed
	description of the parameters!

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 2.3.1 "Message format in Augmented BNF"
	 - RFC 2812, 3.3 "Sending messages"
	 - RFC 2812, 3.3.2 "Notice"

- PRIVMSG
	PRIVMSG <target>[,<target>[,...]] <message>
	.
	Send a <message> to a given <target>, which can be a user or a
	channel, and report all errors.
	.
	The <target> must follow one of these syntax variants:
	.
	 - <nickname>
	 - <channel>
	 - <user>[%<host>]@<server>
	 - <user>%<host>
	 - <nickname>!<user>@<host>
	.
	If the <target> is a user, a private message is sent directly to this
	user; if it resolves to a channel name, a public message is sent
	to all the members of that channel.
	.
	In addition, IRC Ops can use these two forms to specify the <target>:
	.
	 - #<hostmask>
	 - #<servermask>
	.
	The <mask> can contain the wildcard characters "*" and "?", but must
	contain at least one dot (".") and no wildcard after the last one.
	Then, the <message> is sent to all users matching this <mask>.
	.
	All warnings and errors are reported back to the initiator using
	numeric status codes, which is the only difference to the "NOTICE"
	command, which doesn't report back any errors or warnings at all.
	.
	Please note that clients often use "MSG" as an alias to PRIVMSG, and
	a command "QUERY <nick> [<message>]" to initiate private chats. Both
	are command extensions of the client and never sent to the server.

Status and Informational Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ADMIN
	ADMIN [<target>]
	.
	Show administrative information about an IRC server in the network.
	.
	<target> can be a server name, the nickname of a client connected to
	a specific server, or a mask matching a server name in the network.
	The server of the current connection is used when <target> is omitted.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.4.9 "Admin command"

- INFO
	INFO [<target>]
	.
	Show the version, birth & online time of an IRC server in the network.

- ISON
	ISON <nickname> [<nickname> [...]]
	.
	Query online status of a list of nicknames. The server replies with
	a list only containing nicknames actually connected to a server in
	the network. If no nicknames of the given list are online, an empty
	list is returned to the client requesting the information.

	Please note that "all" IRC daemons even parse separate nicknames in
	a single parameter (like ":nick1 nick2"), and therefore ngIRCd
	implements this behaviour, too.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 4.9 "Ison message"

- LINKS
	LINKS [[<target>] [<mask>]
	.
	List all servers currently registered in the network matching <mask>,
	or all servers if <mask> has been omitted, as seen by the server
	specified by <target> or the local server when <target> is omitted.
	.

	.
	<target> can be a server name, the nickname of a client connected to
	a specific server, or a mask matching a server name in the network.
	The server of the current connection is used when <target> is omitted.

	Please note that ngIRCd ignores the <mask> parameter entirely: it
	is not possible to get information for a part of the network only.

	seen by the server <target>. More than one <channel> can be given
	separated by "," (but not whitespaces!).
	.
	If <channel> has been omitted, all visible users are shown, grouped
	by channel name, and all visible users not being members of at least
	one channel are shown as members of the pseudo channel "*".
	.
	<target> can be a server name, the nickname of a client connected to
	a specific server, or a mask matching a server name in the network.

	.
	 - g  Network-wide bans ("G-Lines").
	 - k  Server-local bans ("K-Lines").
	 - l  Link status (parent server and own link only).

	separated by spaces. The following flags are used:
	.
	 - "-"  The client is "away" (the mode "+a" is set on this client).
	 - "+"  Client seems to be available, at least it isn't marked "away".

	a specific server, or a mask matching a server name in the network.
	The server of the current connection is used when <target> is omitted.
	.
	Please note: in normal operation, the version number ends in a dot
	(".", for example "ngIRCd-20.1."). If it ends in ".1" (for example
	"ngIRCd-20.1.1", same version than before!), the server is running in
	debug-mode; and if it ends in ".2", the "network sniffer" is active!
	Keep your privacy in mind ...

Channel Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- INVITE
	INVITE <nickname> <channel>
	.
	Invite <nickname> to join channel <channel>.
	.
	<channel> does not have to exist, but if it does, only members of the
	channel are allowed to invite other users. If the channel mode "+i"
	is set, only channel "half-ops" (and above) may invite other clients,
	and if channel mode "+V" is set, nobody can invite other users.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.2.7 "Invite message"

	.
	If the channel(s) do not exist, then they will be created.

- KICK
	KICK <channel>[,<channel>[,...]] <nickname>[,<nickname>[,...]] [<reason>]
	.
	Remove users(s) with <nickname>(s) from <channel>(s).
	.
	There must be either exactly one <channel> parameter and multiple
	<nickname> parameters, or as many <channel> parameters as there are
	<nickname> parameters. The <reason> is shown to the users being
	kicked, and the nickname of the current user is used when <reason>
	is omitted.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.2.8 "Kick command"

- LIST
	LIST [<channels> [<server>]]
	.
	List all visible <channels> (comma-seperated list) on the current
	server.
	If <server> is given, the command will be forwarded to <server> for
	evaluation.

	Leave <channels> (comma-separated list), optional with a
	<part-message>.

- TOPIC

	Only <channel> operators are able to set a <topic>.


Administrative Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CONNECT
	CONNECT <target server> [<port> [<remote server> [<mypwd> <peerpwd>]]]
	.
	Instructs the current server, or <remote server> if specified,
	to connect to <target server>.
	.
	To connect <remote server> you need to have remote oper status.
	If <port> is omitted, it uses the server port of the configuration.
	If <mypwd> and <peerpwd> is given, it uses those passwords instead
	of the ones in the configuration.

- DIE
	DIE
	.
	Instructs the server to shut down.

- DISCONNECT
	DISCONNECT [<remote server>]
	.
	Disconnects the current server, or <remote server> if specified.
	To disconnect a <remote server> you need to have remote oper status.

- GLINE
	GLINE <nick!user@hostmask> <seconds> :<reason>
	.
	This command provides timed G-Lines (Network-wide bans).
	If a client matches a G-Line, it cannot connect to any server on
	the IRC network. If you put 0 as <seconds>, it makes the G-Line
	permanent.
	.
	To remove a G-Line, type "GLINE <nick!user@hostmask>".
	To list the G-Lines, type "STATS g".

- KILL
	KILL <nickname> <reason>
	.
	Forcibly remove all users with a given <nickname> from the IRC
	network and display the given <reason> to them.
	.
	This command is used internally between servers, too, for example
	to disconnect duplicate <nickname>'s after a "net split".

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.7.1 "Kill message"

- KLINE
	KLINE <nick!user@hostmask> <seconds> :<reason>
	.
	This command provides timed K-Lines (Server-local bans).
	If a client matches a K-Line, it cannot connect to the issued server.
	If you put 0 as <seconds>, it makes the K-Line permanent.
	.
	To remove a K-Line, type "KLINE <nick!user@hostmask>".
	To list the K-Lines, type "STATS k".

- OPER
	OPER <user> <password>
	.
	Authenticates <user> as an IRC operator on the current server/network.

- REHASH
	REHASH
	.
	Causes the server to re-read and re-process its configuration file(s).

- RESTART
	RESTART
	.
	Restart the server.

- WALLOPS
	WALLOPS <message>
	.
	Sends <message> to all users with user mode "+w".


IRC Service Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SERVICE

- SERVLIST
	SERVLIST [<mask> [<type>]]
	.
	List all IRC services currently registered in the network.
	.
	The optional <mask> and <type> parameters can be used to limit the
	listing to services matching the <mask> and that are of type <type>.
	.
	Please note that ngIRCd doesn't use any service types at the moment
	and therefore all services are of type "0".

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.5.1 "Servlist message"

- SQUERY
	SQUERY <target>[,<target>[,...]] <message>
	.
	Send a <message> to a given <target> IRC service, and report all
	errors.
	.
	The "SQUERY" command exactly behaves like the "PRIVMSG" command, but
	enforces that the <target> of the <message> is an IRC service.
	Please see the help text of the "PRIVMSG" command for a detailed
	description of the parameters!
	.
	If a user wants to interact with IRC services, he should use "SQUERY"
	instead of "PRIVMSG" or "NOTICE": only "SQUERY makes sure that no
	regular user, which uses the nickname of an IRC service, receives
	the command in error, for example during a "net split"!

	 - RFC 2812, 2.3.1 "Message format in Augmented BNF"
	 - RFC 2812, 3.3 "Sending messages"
	 - RFC 2812, 3.3.2 "Notice"

- SVSNICK


Server Protocol Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CHANINFO
	CHANINFO <channel> +<modes> [[<key> <limit>] <topic>]
	.
	CHANINFO is used by servers to inform each other about a channel:
	its modes, channel key, user limits and its topic.
	.
	See doc/Protocol.txt for more information.

- ERROR
	ERROR [<message> [<> [...]]]
	.
	Inform a client or a server about an error condition. The first 
	parameter, if given, is logged by the server receiving the message,
	all other parameters are silently ignored.
	.
	This command is silently ignored on non-server and non-service links
	and shouldn't be used by regular IRC clients.
	.
	The ERROR message is also sent before terminating a regular client
	connection.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.7.4 "Error message"

- METADATA
	METADATA <target> <key> <value>
	.
	The METADATA command is used on server-links to update "metadata"
	information of clients, like the hostname, the info text ("real name"),
	or the user name.
	.
	See doc/Protocol.txt for more information.

- NJOIN

- SERVER

- SQUIT
	SQUIT <server>
	.
	Disconnects an IRC Server from the network.


Dummy Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SUMMON
	SUMMON <user> [<target> [<channel>]]
	.
	This command was intended to call people into IRC who are directly
	connected to the terminal console of the IRC server -- but is
	deprecated today. Therefore ngIRCd doesn't really implement this
	command and always returns an error message, regardless of the
	parameters given.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 4.5 "Summon message"

- USERS
	USERS [<target>]
	.
	This command was intended to list users directly logged in into the
	console of the IRC server -- but is deprecated today. Therefore ngIRCd
	doesn't really implement this command and always returns an error
	message, regardless of the parameters given.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 4.6 "Users"

- GET

- POST
