               ngIRCd is free software and published under the
                   terms of the GNU General Public License.

                              -- Commands.txt --


This file lists all commands available on ngIRCd. It is written in a format
that is human readable as well as machine parseable and therefore can be used
as "help text file" of the daemon.

In short, the daemon reads this file on startup and parses it as following
when an user issues a "HELP <cmd>" command:

 1. Search the file for a line "- <cmd>",
 2. Output all subsequent lines that start with a TAB (ASCII 9) character
    to the client using NOTICE commands, treat lines containing a single "."
    after the TAB as empty lines.
 3. Break at the first line not starting with a TAB character.

This format allows to have information to each command stored in this file
which will not be sent to an IRC user requesting help which enables us to
have additional annotations stored here which further describe the origin,
implementation details, or limits of the specific command which are not
relevant to an end-user but administrators and developers.

A special "Intro" block is returned to the user when the HELP command is
used without a command name:


- Intro
	This is ngIRCd, a server software for Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
	networks. You can find more information about ngIRCd on its homepage:
		<http://ngircd.barton.de>
	.
	Use "HELP COMMANDS" to get a list of all available commands and
	"HELP <command-name>" to get help for a specific IRC command, for
	example "HELP quit" or "HELP privmsg".
