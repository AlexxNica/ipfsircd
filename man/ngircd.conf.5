.TH ngircd.conf 5 "March 2003" ngircd "ngIRCd Manual"
.SH NAME
ngircd.conf \- configuration file of ngIRCd
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/local/etc/ngircd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ngircd.conf
is the configuration file for
.B ngircd
which you can adept to your local preferences and needs.
.SH FILE FORMAT
The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the name
of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section
begins.

Sections contain parameters of the form

.RS
.I name
=
.I value
.RE

Any line beginning with a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character is
treated as a comment and ignored.

The file format is line-based - that means, each newline-terminated line
represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.

Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.
.SH SECTION OVERVIEW
The file is separated in four blocks: [Global], [Operator], [Server],
and [Channel].

In the
.I [Global]
section, there is the main configuration like the server name and the
ports, on which the server should be listening. IRC operators of this
server are defined in
.I [Operator]
blocks.
.I [Server]
is the section where server links are configured. And
.I [Channel]
blocks are used to configure pre-defined ("persistent") IRC channels.
.SH [GLOBAL]
The
.I [Global]
section is used to define the server main configuration, like the server
name and the ports on which the server should be listening.
.IP Name
Server name in the IRC network
.IP Info
Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and LINKS requests for
example.
.IP AdminInfo1
.IP AdminInfo2
.IP AdminEMail
Information about the server and the administrator, used by the ADMIN
command.
.IP Ports
Ports on which the server should listen. There may be more than one port,
separated with ';'. Default: 6667.
.IP MotdFile
Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will be shown
to all users connecting to the server.
.IP ServerUID
User ID under which the server should run; you can use the name of the user
or the numerical ID.
.B Attention:
For this to work the server must have been
started with root privileges! In addition, the configuration and MOTD files
must be readable by this user, otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!
.IP ServerGID
Group ID under which the ngircd should run; you can use the name of the
group or the numerical ID.
.B Attention:
For this to work the server must have
been started with root privileges!
.IP PingTimeout
After <PingTimeout> seconds of inactivity the server will send a PING to
the peer to test whether it is alive or not. Default: 120.
.IP PongTimeout
If a client fails to answer a PING with a PONG within <PongTimeout>
seconds, it will be disconnected by the server. Default: 20.
.IP ConnectRetry
The server tries every <ConnectRetry> seconds to establish a link to not yet
(or no longer) connected servers. Default: 60.
.IP OperCanUseMode
Should IRC Operators be allowed to use the MODE command even if they are
not(!) channel-operators? Default: no.
.IP MaxConnections
Maximum number of simultaneous connection the server is allowed to accept
(<=0: unlimited). Default: -1.
.IP MaxJoins
Maximum number of channels a user can be member of (<=0: no limit).
Default: 10.
.SH [OPERATOR]
.I [Operator]
sections are used to define IRC Operators. There may be more than one
.I [Operator]
block, one for each local operator.
.IP Name
ID of the operator (may be different of the nick name).
.IP Password
Password of the IRC operator.
.SH [SERVER]
Other servers are configured in
.I [Server]
sections. If you configure a port for the connection, then this ngircd
tries to connect to to the other server on the given port; if not it waits
for the other server to connect.

The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every server
with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a group won't
answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server in the given group.
But the ngircd never tries to connect to two servers with the same group ID.

There may be more than one server block.
.IP Name
IRC name of the server
.IP Host
Internet host name of the peer
.IP Port
Port of the server to which the ngIRCd should connect. If you assign no port
the ngIRCd waits for incoming connections.
.IP MyPassword
Own password for this connection. This password has to be configured as
"PeerPassword" on the other server.
.IP PeerPassword
Foreign password for this connection. This password has to be configured as
"MyPassword" on the other server.
.IP Group
Group of this server (optional).
.SH [Channel]
Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections. Such channels
are created by the server when starting up and even persist when there are
no more members left.

Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set and unset
by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.

There may be more than one [Channel] block.
.IP Name
Name of the channel
.IP Topic
Topic for this channel
.IP Modes
Initial channel modes.
