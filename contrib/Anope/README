This directory contains two preliminary patches that (re-) add a ngIRCd
protocol module to the Anope 1.9 development branch. It has been tested
with Anope 1.9.6, there is no guarantee that it will work with other
versions as Anope 1.9.x is under heavy development ...

To build this Anope protocol module, you have to

 - Download the Anope 1.9.x sources (only tested with 1.9.6!),
 - Patch in the ngIRCd protocol module,
 - Build and install Anope as usual,
 - Configure Anope as usual, use "ngircd" as protocol module.

So the command sequence can be something like this:

 $ tar xzf anope-1.9.6-source.tar.gz
 $ cd anope-1.9.6-source
 $ for p in .../ngircd/contrib/Anope/*.patch ; do patch -p1 < $p ; done
 $ ./Config
 $ cd build
 $ make
 $ make install

Please have a look at the file doc/Services.txt for more information about
how to set up ngIRCd and Anope.
